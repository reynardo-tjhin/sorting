# sorting

Implemented 6 different kinds of sorting algorithms:
1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Counting Sort
5. Heap Sort
6. Merge Sort
*All the algorithms are implemented by me.
However, the ideas or concepts are taken from USYD COMP2123 Semester 1 2020 Lectures 5, 10 and 11
and from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/
